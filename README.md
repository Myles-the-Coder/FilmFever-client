FilmFever is a full-stack JavaScript application that allows users to access information about different movies, genres, and directors. Built using the MERN stack, FilmFever uses a built from scratch database and server to provide movie data to users on the application's front-end. Users can create an account, read information about different movies, update their information and favorite movies list, and delete their accounts if desired. These actions follow the core principles that are integral to a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application.

Initial 1.0 Version Duration: October 2021 - November 2021
